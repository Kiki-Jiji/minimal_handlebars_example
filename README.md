# AJAX need server
navigate into the folder where  you plan on saving your `.html` files and execute the following command:

    ```python
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
    ```
    if you're using Python 3.x or higher, you'd use
    ```python
    python -m http.server 1337
    ```

  Then go to `localhost:1337` and access `index.html`
