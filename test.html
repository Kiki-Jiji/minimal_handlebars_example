      <h2>Why {{flavor}} is the best</h2>
      <p>
        It is without a doubt that {{flavor}} is the best ice cream flavor in the world. If it was left to me, I would have {{flavor}} ice cream all year round. The next time I get ice cream, I will be getting {{flavor}} because why get something else when when you can get the best.
